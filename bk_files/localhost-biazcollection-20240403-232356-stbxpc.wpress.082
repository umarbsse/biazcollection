	 * Creates the essential files in Jetpack to start building a Gutenberg block or plugin.
	 *
	 * ## TYPES
	 *
	 * block: it creates a Jetpack block. All files will be created in a directory under extensions/blocks named based on the block title or a specific given slug.
	 *
	 * ## BLOCK TYPE OPTIONS
	 *
	 * The first parameter is the block title and it's not associative. Add it wrapped in quotes.
	 * The title is also used to create the slug and the edit PHP class name. If it's something like "Logo gallery", the slug will be 'logo-gallery' and the class name will be LogoGalleryEdit.
	 * --slug: Specific slug to identify the block that overrides the one generated based on the title.
	 * --description: Allows to provide a text description of the block.
	 * --keywords: Provide up to three keywords separated by comma so users can find this block when they search in Gutenberg's inserter.
	 * --variation: Allows to decide whether the block should be a production block, experimental, or beta. Defaults to Beta when arg not provided.
	 *
	 * ## BLOCK TYPE EXAMPLES
	 *
	 * wp jetpack scaffold block "Cool Block"
	 * wp jetpack scaffold block "Amazing Rock" --slug="good-music" --description="Rock the best music on your site"
	 * wp jetpack scaffold block "Jukebox" --keywords="music, audio, media"
	 * wp jetpack scaffold block "Jukebox" --variation="experimental"
	 *
	 * @subcommand scaffold block
	 * @synopsis <type> <title> [--slug] [--description] [--keywords] [--variation]
