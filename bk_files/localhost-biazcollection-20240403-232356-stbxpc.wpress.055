/**
 * This message defines the standard attribute vocabulary for Google APIs.
 * An attribute is a piece of metadata that describes an activity on a network
 * service. For example, the size of an HTTP request, or the status code of
 * an HTTP response.
 * Each attribute has a type and a name, which is logically defined as
 * a proto message field in `AttributeContext`. The field type becomes the
 * attribute type, and the field path becomes the attribute name. For example,
 * the attribute `source.ip` maps to field `AttributeContext.source.ip`.
 * This message definition is guaranteed not to have any wire breaking change.
 * So you can use it directly for passing attributes across different systems.
 * NOTE: Different system may generate different subset of attributes. Please
 * verify the system specification before relying on an attribute generated
 * a system.

/**
 * Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed
 * for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various
 * languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation
 * can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it
 * can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha`
 * method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into
 * a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript.
 * This reference page doesn't carry information about the absolute color
 * space
 * that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB,
 * DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color
 * space.
 * When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless
 * documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red,
 * green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5.
 * Example (Java):
 *      import com.google.type.Color;
 *      // ...
 *      public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) {
 *        float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha()
 *            ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue()
 *            : 1.0;
 *        return new java.awt.Color(
 *            protocolor.getRed(),
 *            protocolor.getGreen(),
 *            protocolor.getBlue(),
 *            alpha);
 *      }
 *      public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) {
 *        float red = (float) color.getRed();
 *        float green = (float) color.getGreen();
 *        float blue = (float) color.getBlue();
 *        float denominator = 255.0;
 *        Color.Builder resultBuilder =
 *            Color
 *                .newBuilder()
 *                .setRed(red / denominator)
 *                .setGreen(green / denominator)
 *                .setBlue(blue / denominator);
 *        int alpha = color.getAlpha();
 *        if (alpha != 255) {
 *          result.setAlpha(
 *              FloatValue

 *    day with a particular offset from UTC.
 *  * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is unset: a civil time on a calendar
 *    day in a particular time zone.
 *  * When neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar
 *    day in local time.
 * The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar.
 * If year is 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year. month
 * and day must have valid, non-zero values.
 * This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and
 * time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set.
 * Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use
 * case also would like to store the user's timezone, that can be done in
 * another field.
 * This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make sure to
 * document and validate your application's limitations.

     * The decimal value, as a string.
     * The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`)

     * ("the integer"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed
     * by an exponent.
     * The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal
     * digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer
     * or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the
     * fraction is referred to as the significand.
     * The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`)
     * followed by one or more decimal digits.
     * Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by:
     *   - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -> `2.5`).
     *   - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -> `0.5`).
     *   - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -> `2.5e8`).
     *   - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -> `2.5`).
     * Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs
     * and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the
     * decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` <-> `0.25`).
     * Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction
     * to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so.
     * Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer
     * and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale.
     * Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a
     * service does support them, values **must** be normalized.
     * The ENBF grammar is:
     *     DecimalString =
     *       [Sign] Significand [Exponent];
     *     Sign = '+' | '-';
     *     Significand =
     *       Digits ['.'] [Digits] | [Digits] '.' Digits;
     *     Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits;
     *     Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' };
     * Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the
     * maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable,
     * the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it
     * behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values.
     * Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the
     * value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and
     * **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the
     * service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC)
     * if precision would be lost.

     * The decimal value, as a string.
     * The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`)
     * or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits
     * ("the integer"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed
     * by an exponent.
     * The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal
     * digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer
     * or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the
     * fraction is referred to as the significand.
     * The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`)
     * followed by one or more decimal digits.
     * Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by:
     *   - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -> `2.5`).
     *   - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -> `0.5`).
     *   - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -> `2.5e8`).
     *   - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -> `2.5`).
     * Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs
     * and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the
     * decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` <-> `0.25`).
     * Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction
     * to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so.
     * Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer
     * and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale.
     * Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a
     * service does support them, values **must** be normalized.
     * The ENBF grammar is:
     *     DecimalString =
     *       [Sign] Significand [Exponent];
     *     Sign = '+' | '-';
     *     Significand =
     *       Digits ['.'] [Digits] | [Digits] '.' Digits;
     *     Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits;
     *     Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' };
     * Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the
     * maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable,
     * the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it
     * behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values.
     * Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the
     * value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and
     * **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the
     * service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC)
     * if precision would be lost.
     * Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in
     * gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.

/**
 * A quaternion is defined as the quotient of two directed lines in a
 * three-dimensional space or equivalently as the quotient of two Euclidean
 * vectors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion).
 * Quaternions are often used in calculations involving three-dimensional
 * rotations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation),
 * as they provide greater mathematical robustness by avoiding the gimbal lock
 * problems that can be encountered when using Euler angles
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock).
 * Quaternions are generally represented in this form:
 *     w + xi + yj + zk
 * where x, y, z, and w are real numbers, and i, j, and k are three imaginary
 * numbers.
 * Our naming choice `(x, y, z, w)` comes from the desire to avoid confusion for
 * those interested in the geometric properties of the quaternion in the 3D
 * Cartesian space. Other texts often use alternative names or subscripts, such
 * as `(a, b, c, d)`, `(1, i, j, k)`, or `(0, 1, 2, 3)`, which are perhaps
 * better suited for mathematical interpretations.
 * To avoid any confusion, as well as to maintain compatibility with a large
 * number of software libraries, the quaternions represented using the protocol
 * buffer below *must* follow the Hamilton convention, which defines `ij = k`
 * (i.e. a right-handed algebra), and therefore:
 *     i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = 1
 *     ij = ji = k
 *     jk = kj = i
 *     ki = ik = j
 * Please DO NOT use this to represent quaternions that follow the JPL
 * convention, or any of the other quaternion flavors out there.
 * Definitions:
 *   - Quaternion norm (or magnitude): `sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2)`.
 *   - Unit (or normalized) quaternion: a quaternion whose norm is 1.
 *   - Pure quaternion: a quaternion whose scalar component (`w`) is 0.
 *   - Rotation quaternion: a unit quaternion used to represent rotation.
 *   - Orientation quaternion: a unit quaternion used to represent orientation.
 * A quaternion can be normalized by dividing it by its norm. The resulting
 * quaternion maintains the same direction, but has a norm of 1, i.e. it moves
 * on the unit sphere. This is generally necessary for rotation and orientation
 * quaternions, to avoid rounding errors:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_formalisms_in_three_dimensions
 * Note that `(x, y, z, w)` and `(-x, -y, -z, -w)` represent the same rotation,
 * but normalization would be even more useful, e.g. for comparison purposes, if
 * it would produce a unique representation. It is thus recommended that `w` be
 * kept positive, which can be achieved by changing all the signs when `w` is
 * negative.

As contributors and maintainers of this project,
and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community,
we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues,

We are committed to making participation in this project
a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,

body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information,
such as physical or electronic
addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
By adopting this Code of Conduct,
project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently
applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
may be permanently removed from the project team.

when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by opening an issue
or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.

![Build Status](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-php/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

-   [Documentation](https://googleapis.github.io/gax-php)

Google API Core for PHP (gax-php) is a set of modules which aids the development
of APIs for clients based on [gRPC][] and Google API conventions.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this library
directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition files in
[Google APIs][] can use services such as page streaming and retry to provide a
more convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.

[gRPC]: http://grpc.io
[Google APIs]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/

## PHP Versions

gax-php currently requires PHP 5.6 or higher.

## Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.

See the [CONTRIBUTING][] documentation for more information on how to get
started.

[CONTRIBUTING]: https://github.com/googleapis/gax-php/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning][].

This library is considered GA (generally available). As such, it will not
introduce backwards-incompatible changes in any minor or patch releases. We will
address issues and requests with the highest priority.

[Semantic Versioning]: http://semver.org/

## Repository Structure

All code lives under the src/ directory. Handwritten code lives in the
src/ApiCore directory and is contained in the `Google\ApiCore` namespace.

Generated classes for protobuf common types and LongRunning client live under
the src/ directory, in the appropriate directory and namespace.

Code in the metadata/ directory is provided to support generated protobuf
classes, and should not be used directly.

## Development Set-Up

These steps describe the dependencies to install for Linux, and equivalents can
be found for Mac or Windows.

1.  Install dependencies.

    ```sh
    > cd ~/
    > sudo apt-get install php php-dev libcurl3-openssl-dev php-pear php-bcmath php-xml
    > curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    > sudo pecl install protobuf
    ```

2.  Set up this repo.

    ```sh
    > cd /path/to/gax-php
    > cp ~/composer.phar ./
    > php composer.phar install
    ```

3.  Run tests.

    ```sh
    > vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap tests/bootstrap.php tests
    ```

4.  Updating dependencies after changing `composer.json`:

    ```sh
    > php composer.phar update
    `
    ```

5.  Formatting source:

    ```sh
    > vendor/bin/phpcbf -s --standard=./ruleset.xml
    > vendor/bin/phpcs -s --standard=./ruleset.xml
    ```

     *     @type bool $disableRetries
     *           Determines whether or not retries defined by the client configuration should be
     *           disabled. Defaults to `false`.
     *     @type string|array $clientConfig
     *           Client method configuration, including retry settings. This option can be either a
     *           path to a JSON file, or a PHP array containing the decoded JSON data.
     *           By default this settings points to the default client config file, which is provided
     *           in the resources folder.
     *     @type string|array|FetchAuthTokenInterface|CredentialsWrapper $credentials
     *           The credentials to be used by the client to authorize API calls. This option
     *           accepts either a path to a credentials file, or a decoded credentials file as a
     *           PHP array.
     *           *Advanced usage*: In addition, this option can also accept a pre-constructed
     *           \Google\Auth\FetchAuthTokenInterface object or \Google\ApiCore\CredentialsWrapper
     *           object. Note that when one of these objects are provided, any settings in

/**
 * Response object for paged results from a list API method
 *
 * The PagedListResponse object is returned by API methods that implement
 * pagination, and makes it easier to access multiple pages of results
 * without having to manually manipulate page tokens. Pages are retrieved
 * lazily, with additional API calls being made as additional results
 * are required.
 *
 * The list elements can be accessed in the following ways:
 *  - As a single iterable used in a foreach loop or via the getIterator method
 *  - As pages of elements, using the getPage and iteratePages methods
 *  - As fixed size collections of elements, using the
 *    getFixedSizeCollection and iterateFixedSizeCollections methods
 *
 * Example of using PagedListResponse as an iterator:
 * ```
 * $pagedListResponse = $client->getList(...);
 * foreach ($pagedListResponse as $element) {
 *     // doSomethingWith($element);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Example of iterating over each page of elements:
 * ```
 * $pagedListResponse = $client->getList(...);
 * foreach ($pagedListResponse->iteratePages() as $page) {
 *     foreach ($page as $element) {
 *         // doSomethingWith($element);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Example of accessing the current page, and manually iterating
 * over pages:
 * ```
 * $pagedListResponse = $client->getList(...);
 * $page = $pagedListResponse->getPage();
 * // doSomethingWith($page);
 * while ($page->hasNextPage()) {
 *     $page = $page->getNextPage();
 *     // doSomethingWith($page);
 * }
 * ```
